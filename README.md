# Microcomputer Basics Final Test
## Preface
This repo containing of .ino file to run the small project of microcomputer basics. Verify and upload the file from Arduino IDE. This project run 8 LEDs in 3 commands : 
1. Turning on the middle lane of the LED sequences, and spreading to the edges. 
2. Showing voltage value through the LED sequences, the higher the voltage value, more LEDs are turned on.
3. Using interrupt button 

## Hardware Requirements
The required hardware components consisting of : 
1. Atmega 328P
2. LED x 8 + 220 ohm resistor x 8
3. Breadboard
4. Kapasitor 22 nF x 2
5. Jumper cables (as necessary)
6. Button x 1 + resistor 10k ohm => as reset button
7. Keypad with 4x4 layout x 1
8. FTDI module as power source x 1
9. Arduino Uno R3 x 1 (as  uploader)
10. Breadboard x 1
